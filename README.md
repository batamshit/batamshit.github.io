Keyboard Configs for osu!taiko :

Those are ONLY for Wooting Keyboards

V1 : 2668bc89b9fe24f7faa7026839d31e1d89ab

V2 : 1619fd77aac5ccaf4af026035c15d677662d

---- 

The V1 is only focused on SPEED which i mainly use for streaming maps and things like that.
V2 Version is great for speed but is really good for maps that doesn't have streams in it, basically it allows me personnaly to do less miss-clicks when playing, in the V1 because of the sensitivity of Rapid Trigger they're are mostly some miss-clicks that happens often, V2 is made to avoid those miss-clicks but still has a really good sensitivity to play on stream maps.
